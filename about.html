    <h1>We are Whiteboard Federal Technologies.</h1>
    <p>
    But most people shorten it to Whiteboard. Or WBF.

    <p>
    We're the people most people never see, supporting some of the most intensive national security missions that exist. Like you, we don't have much choice in the matter. Someone has to dive in. Someone has to deliver. Someone has to marry expertise to vision; someone has to do the heavy lifting. Someone has to make sure that our nation's safety transcends political and ideological divides, to guarantee that there will always be a tomorrow. So, we're here for the same reason you are.
  </p>
     
    <p>
    And we cordially invite you to join us.
    </p>
     
    <p>
    Now in our second decade of delivering expertise, clarity and innovation in support of our homeland's defense and intelligence customers, we define that easily-bandied word "results" as outcomes and products that distill value from complexity and produce actionable solutions. We offer an uncommon combination of talent and passion to address a multitude of issues of national significance -- all in a robust and timely manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Much as any good organization does, we listen. We pay attention to the goals of our customer. And we achieve those goals by giving every member of our team the tools and the room to succeed. We hire top tier technologists and clear the way for their analytical instincts, their insights, their sense of radical invention. And reinvention. Which, we think, is a great way to fulfill our obligation to the mission and realize our shared goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    In short, we're Whiteboard: We provide the bridge from noise to clarity, from data to results. So we'll say it once again . . . come join us!
