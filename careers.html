          Our core philosophy: <em>Make Whiteboard a company where we'd want to spend our careers.</em> 
          This thinking drives our decision-making; it’s why we go after work that's compelling 
          and challenging, and why we partner on the most impactful, progressive programs as 
          they arrive. It’s why we employ vanguard technologies and strive to introduce them onto those programs. 
          It’s why we offer robust training -- to keep our team members at the forefront of mission impact.      
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p class="lead mb-4 mb-md-0">      
          Years of onsite experience and collaboration with the customer have given our leaders deep insight 
          into the realities of the workspace, which allows us to be especially responsive to your needs. 
          We prioritize job satisfaction, working hard initially to find you a great fit, and redeploying 
          you when you seek something fresh.
