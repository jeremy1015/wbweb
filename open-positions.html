		<h3>Why work for Whiteboard?</h3>
		<p>Let us answer that by asking you a question. What motivates you? We think there are a whole bunch of compelling reasons to work here, but each of us is at our own place in life and is motivated by different factors. Let's hit the ones we hear about most often:</p>

		<h4>Small Company Environment</h4>

		<p>You'll never be an employee number or a line item on a spreadsheet here. We don't play the butts in seats game even though we're a subcontractor. We make sure our people are taken care of, and that includes making sure their working environment suits them. You can come knock on the President's door any time.</p>

		<h4>Technology</h4>

		<p>We strive to work with the most cutting edge technology we can. In our sector, this can be a challenge but we achieve it in two ways - by going after the coolest programs we can and by introducing new technologies and solutions to our customers once we're on site.</p>

		<p>While we're all over the map, we're working on tech as diverse and cutting edge as databases like Hadoop/Accumulo and MongoDB, advanced languages like Python and Clojure, cutting edge environments like NodeJS, modern front end frameworks like AngularJS, and awesome tools like Splunk and Amazon Web Services.</p>

		<p>While we're on the topic, we didn't pay a design company to build this website. We built it ourselves using Jekyll, host it on GitHub, and mixed in a little customized Twitter Bootstrap for the bling factor.</p>

		<h4>Compensation</h4>

		<p>Last time we checked, nobody comes to work for free. And we know that in our community, engineers are in demand. We respond with what we call the golden handcuffs - we simply pay more than our competition and take less profit per employee. Does that mean we grow slower? Yes, but we don't exactly have a lot of turnover either.</p>

		<h4>Understanding our Community</h4>

		<p>Some of the members of our Executive Leadership Team are actually engineers working mission on site, hand in hand with the government. We know the best and the worst of being cleared engineers in our community, and that allows us to be responsive to our employees' needs.</p>

		<p>Unlike a lot of subcontractors, we aren't committed to just filling any open slot on any program we can get our hands on. The mission that we serve on matters to us, as does the way that our programs get run. We work carefully to be involved in the best programs we can, to be assured that our engineers have a fulfilling work environment</p>
