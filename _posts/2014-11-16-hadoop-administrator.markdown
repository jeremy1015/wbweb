summary: We are looking for a very strong Hadoop Administrator to join us on a proof of concept initiative where a small group will be setting up a Hadoop environment from scratch.
---

While the project is research oriented, its fruits will be applied to a mission-critical system. Engineers will enjoy the fun, experimental, and fast-paced nature of a proof of concept program, with the satisfaction of building technology that will be utilized. This position is for someone who combines serious technical skills, a thirst for challenge, and enough humility to be self-reflective about their technical decisions.

#### Required / Desired

* True, solid, hands-on Hadoop administrator experience! (We love architects, systems engineers, systems administrators, and developers with Hadoop experience - and we would be happy to talk with them about other programs we work on - but this role requires actual hands-on Hadoop administration experience.)

* Firm knowledge of HDFS and MapReduce

* Experience setting up clusters, preferably from the ground up, preferred

* Experience maintaining and monitoring clusters

* Ability to create patches, script, and do some software development

* A deep understanding of Hadoop design principles and factors that affect distributed system performance, including hardware and network considerations/configurations

* Ability to load data into the cluster from dynamically-generated files using Flume and from relational database management systems using Sqoop, preferred

* A firm handle on what system administration issues exist within the Hadoop ecosystem and associated components such as Hive, Pig, and HBase
